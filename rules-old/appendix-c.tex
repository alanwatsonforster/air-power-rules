\appendixchapter{Updating ADCs}

ADCs for many aircraft have been published in {\AirSup}, {\AirStr}, {\TSOH}, and {\APJ}. Still more have been created by players interested in less common aircraft. 

Many of the values in these ADCs remains relevant under the current rules, but some need updating. This appendix describes how to identify and update earlier ADCs.


\section{Identifying ADC Versions}

First-edition ADCs can be identified in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize} 
\item They have the idle power labeled “Idle FP” or similar and the speedbrake row labeled “Spbr.\ FP” or similar. 
\item They have “v1” in the upper right, next to the text “Air Power”.
\end{itemize}

Second-edition ADCs can be identified in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize} 
\item They have the idle power labeled “Idle DP” or similar and the speedbrake row labeled “Spbr.\ DP” or similar. 
\item They have “v2” in the upper right, next to the text “Air Power”.
\end{itemize}

\section{Updating First-Edition ADCs}

To update first-edition ADCs for the second-edition rules:

\subsection{Idle and Speedbrake DPs}


\begin{itemize}

\itemaddedin{2A}{2A-idle}{Multiply the “Idle FP” values by two and interpret them as Idle DP values.}
\itemaddedin{2A}{2A-spbr}{Multiply the “Spbr.\ FP” values by two and interpret them as SPBR DP values.}

\end{itemize}
