\begin{enumerate}
    \item Regular FOV = As Limited radar arc
    \item Uncaged FOV = 180+ angle-off arcs
    \item Uncaged FOV with Helmet sight = 150+ angle-off arcs
    \item Uncaged FOV with radar assist = lesser of 150+ or radar arc
    \item Uncaged FOV with VAS assist (M, A only) = 180+ arcs
    \item IRSTS Assisted FOV = Same as IRSTS system
    \medskip
    \item[--] If target one of several in unassisted Uncaged FOV a roll of \minusafter{8} is required for seeker lock-on; \minusafter{9} with helmet sights. Modifier of \plus{1} to roll for each aircraft the seeker must look past.
