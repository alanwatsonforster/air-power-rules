\appendixchapter{Helicopter Data}

The Helicopter Data Table (Table \ref{table:helicopter-data}) gives data on helicopters. Its columns are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The helicopter type and name. The NATO reporting name is given in parentheses. 
  \item Whether it has high speed/agility (HSA).
  \item Its visilbility, size, vulnerability, and blind arc.
  \item Its characteristics when treated as a ground unit: its soft defense strength (before the dash) and maximum sighting range (after the dash).
  \item For gun-armed helicopters: the gun type, arc, ammunition, hit rolls, and damage ratings.
  \item Its ECM capability: its DDS type, IRM suppression modifier, RWR type, and DJM type. Some helicopters have multiple DDS systems. The IRM suppression modifier is applied to IRM and IR SAM attacks.
  \item Its technology: whether it has TV/IR optics, a laser spot tracker, a laser designator, a helmet-mounted sight (HMS), or a mast-mounted sight (MMS).
\end{itemize}
The notes below the Helicopter Data Table give additional information on helicopter armament.
