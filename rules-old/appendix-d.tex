\appendixchapter{Converting Harpoon Ship Data}
\label{appendix:converting-harpoon-ship-data}

The {\Harpoon} game and its many supplements are a great source of data on warships and auxiliaries. This appendix describes a procedure to convert {\Harpoon} ship data to {\AirPow} ship data. The procedure gives a first approximation, which should then be refined.

\begin{itemize}
\item \itemparagraph{Size and Type.} These are the same in {\AirPow} and {\Harpoon}.
\item \itemparagraph{Maximum Speed.} This is the same in {\AirPow} and {\Harpoon}.
\item \itemparagraph{VPs.} There is no procedure to determine VPs.
\item \itemparagraph{Defense Strength.} Small, medium, and large warships have defense strengths of 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Small, medium, and large merchant ships have defense strengths of 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Steel and aluminum ships are hard targets and wooden ships are soft targets.
\item \itemparagraph{Spotting Range.} Small, medium, and large ships have spotting ranges of 24, 36, and 48, respectively.
\item \itemparagraph{Hull.} The hull value is calculated from the {\Harpoon} damage point (DP) value as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the DP value is less than 240, divide by 40 and round to the nearest integer, rounding halves up.
    \item If the DP value is 240 or more, subtract 240, divide by 150, add 6, and round to the nearest integer, rounding halves up.
\end{itemize}
That is,
$$
\mbox{Hull} = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        $[DP/40]$&\quad \mbox{if $\mbox{DP} < 240$ and}\\
        $[(DP-240)/150 + 6]$&\quad \mbox{if $\mbox{DP} \ge 240$,}\\
    \end{array}
\right.
$$
in which $[x]$ means round to the nearest integer, rounding halves up.
\item \itemparagraph{Sink.} Small, medium, and large warships have sink values of 8, 10, and 12, respectively. Small, medium, and large merchant ships have sink values of 6, 8, and 10, respectively.
\item \itemparagraph{Jam and Decoys.} 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation jammers and decoys in {\Harpoon} correspond to jammer and decoy values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
\item \itemparagraph{Radars.} 
\item \itemparagraph{Gun Directors.} 
\item \itemparagraph{AAA.} 
\item \itemparagraph{SAM.} 
\end{itemize}
