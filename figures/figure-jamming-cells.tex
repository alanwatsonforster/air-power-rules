    \item To be in a valid Jamming Cell formation, aircraft must be in adjacent hexes (as depicted), with no more than 30 degrees difference in facing and within 1 altitude level of an adjacent aircraft.
    \item The maximum size of a jamming cell is 4 aircraft. Each aircraft within those parameters has its ECM jammer rating increased by 1.
