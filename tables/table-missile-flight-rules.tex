FP Costs
\medskip

\begin{enumerate}
    \item One FP to move forward one hex/hexside.
    \item One FP to climb 1 or 2 Altitude levels.
    \item Free lost of 1 level per hex entered.
    \item One FP to dive 2 or 3 Altitude levels.
    \item Once per turn may dive 1 level with 1 FP.
    \item One FP to Snap-turn or Slide, 0 FP to vert.\ roll.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Manuever Limits
\medskip

\begin{enumerate}
    \item One Snap-turn allowed during entire flight.
    \item Only Slide and Vertical roll maneuvers allowed.
    \item Normally, 1 Vert.\ roll allowed in entire flight except anytime target performs one, missiles may in next move.
    \item If Snap-turn first action other than forward flight after missile arms, no prep-move required.
    \item If missile turns, or switches between climbs and dives before Snap-turning, normal prep-move must be met.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Flight Restrictions
\medskip

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Missiles may climb and dive in same game turn, and some may do both in same proportional move.
    \item Vertical roll allowed when msl.\ expends 2 or more FPs while climbing or diving in same position.
    \item If turn ability is not BT/2, ET/2, or ET/3 then missile is limited to switching between climbs and dives. Sich missiles may do either in proportional move but not both. Before changing between the two, missile must spend 1 proportional move in level flt.
    \item Missiles may never dive if already below their target.
    \item Missiles may only climb if already above their target if;
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item They are CG SAMs in boot phase.
        \item They are TVM SAMs of MCG missiles.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Missile Speed Changes
\medskip

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If missile gained altitude over turn, $-1$ to speed for each set of alt.\ levels climbed equal to half or less of missile's speed.
    \item If missile lost altitude over turn, $+1$ to speed for each set of alt.\ levels dived equal to half or more of missile's speed.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Missile Speed Determination
\medskip

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Air to air first turn = $(\textrm{Base} + \textrm{aircraft}) \times \textrm{Speed Att.\ Factor}$.
    \item SAM first turn = listed Base Speed.
    \item Subsequent turns = $(\textrm{Previous} \pm \textrm{changes})  \times \textrm{Speed Att.\ factor}$.
    \item If sustainer motor in effect, Speed Att.\ Factor = 1.0.
\end{enumerate}
