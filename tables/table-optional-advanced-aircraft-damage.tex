\hline
&&$+1$ to all attacks, $+1$ to weapons launches.\\
1&Airframe&No supersonic speeds allowed.$^*$\\
2&Airframe&No BT or ET turn rate allowed.\\
3&Controls&Aircraft becomes Low roll rate and loses any high pitch rate capability.\\
4&Controls&Add one to prep-move requirements for all maneuvers.\\
5&Fuel&Lose 1 point of fuel per game turn, double bingo fuel amount. White Vapor emitted.\\
6&Avionics&Radar knocked out and lose all technology.\\
7&Avionics&Bombsight degraded to manual, gunsight = TT+1, HT+2, BT+3.\\
8&Weapons&Internal guns/gun pods disabled.\\
9&Engines&Afterburner disabled. No A/B power available.\\
10&Engines&Thrust loss; reduce Mil and A/B power numbers by 0.5. White Vapor emitted.\\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Heavy Damage}\\
\hline
&&+2 to all attacks, +2 to weapon launches.\\
1,2&Airframe&No supersonic flight.$^*$ No BT or ET turns. Low roll rate. No high pitch rate. Add two to prep-move requirements for all maneuvers.\\
3&Controls&No rolling maneuvers allowed. Low roll rate. No high pitch rate. No ET turn rate.\\
4&Controls&Throttle jammed, no power changes. No HT, BT, or ET turn rate. No high pitch rate.\\
5&Fuel&Lose 2 points of fuel per turn. Bingo fuel tripled. Roll one die each turn after flight. On 1, a FUEL FIRE occurs (see description below). Aircraft becomes Smoker.\\
6,7&Avionics&Radar knocked out, all ECM knocked out, and lose all technology\\
8&Weapons&Guns disabled, no RHM/AHM/ARM/ASM missile or BS/RS weapon launches allowed.\\
9,10&Engines&Mil and A/B power halved. Roll for flame out whenever power setting changed. On 1, a Flame-Out occurs in one good engine. Aircraft becomes a smoker.\\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Critical Damage}\\
\hline
&&$+3$ to all attacks, $+3$ to weapon launches. Roll once on the H table and once below.\\
1&Cockpit&Roll die again: 1, 2 = pilot killed (aircraft lost). 3, 4 = Crewman Killed (lose multi-crew functions). +5 = crew okay. Regardless, treat aircraft as having both an Airframe and Avionics hit as described immediately below.\\
2,3&Airframe&
No supersonic flight.$^*$ Low roll rate. No high pitch. No rolling maneuvers. EZ turns only. Aircraft must jettison external stores.\\
4,5,6&Avionics&Lose radar, all ECM, and all technology. No external pods work. Bombsight degrades to manual and gunsight = TT+1, HT+2, BT+3.\\
7&Fuel Fire**&Aircraft becomes Smoker. Lose 3 die rolls of fuel/turn. Jettison external stores. Roll die after each turn after flight. On 1 or 2 aircraft explodes, crew killed. On 9 or 10, fire goes out permanently but fuel leak still there.\\
8,9,10&Engines&A/B power lost. Mli power halved. Aircraft becomes Smoker. Roll for flame-outs twice per engine (1 or 2 = F.O. in this case). On subsequent turns, roll for flame-out whenever power seting is changed (1 = F.O.).\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item The specifics of the damage rolled are not revealed to the enemy, but are recorded on paper. Visible signs of damage such as smoke or vapor, as indicated on the tables, must be told to the opponent.
    \item Jettison of Stores: Only the results calling for jettison of ordnance require an aircraft to do so. If this is the case, the aircraft must jettison enough stores to become CL configured. 
    \item If table indicates damage to a system or performance capability that the aircraft does not have, roll again. If the second roll also results in non-applicable damage, the hit is still recorded for the die roll penalties on combat and for possible progressive damage.
   \item[$^*$] If supersonic speeds exceeded in game turn, roll for progressive damage twice even if Damage Control was done.
   \item[$^{**}$] A Fuel Fire and risk of explosion can only be stopped by shutting down all engines. Declare this when doing damage control. Treat aircraft as flamed-out. When engines relit, A/B is disabled. Roll one die, on 1 to 4 fire resumes permanently; otherwise it stays out.
