\begin{enumerate}
    \item Regular FOV = As Limited radar arc
    \item Uncaged FOV = 180+ angle-off arcs
    \item Uncaged FOV with Helmet sight = 150+ angle-off arcs
    \item Uncaged FOV with radar assist = lesser of 150+ or radar arc
    \item Uncaged FOV with VAS assist (M, A only) = 180+ arcs
    \item IRSTS Assisted FOV = Same as IRSTS system
    \medskip
    \item[--] If target one of several in unassisted Uncaged FOV a roll of $8-$ is required for seeker lock-on; $9-$ with helmet sights. Modifier of $+1$ to roll for each aircraft the seeker must look past.
