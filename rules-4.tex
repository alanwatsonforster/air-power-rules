\section{Aircraft Data Cards}

This chapter discusses the Aircraft Data Cards (ADCs) and the information presented on them. Each aircraft used in play has its flight and combat capabilities fully defined in game terms in its ADC. A sample ADC is shown on the following pages.  It is divided into two major panels: The Flight Characteristics panel and the Combat Characteristics panel.

\subsection{Flight Characteristics Panel}

\input{figures/figure-adc}
    
The Flight Characteristics panel is the top half of the ADC and it contains information which defines the flying capabilities of the aircraft. This panel is divided into the following sections:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \itemparagraph{Aircraft Type.} The upper right corner contains the name most commonly used to identify that type of aircraft. It also shows the number of crew positions on the aircraft.

    \item \itemparagraph{Three-View.} The 3-view drawing is included to familiarize the player with the appearance of the aircraft. The top view will be similar to that used on a corresponding game counter.

    \item \itemparagraph{Basic Data.} The center of the panel contains the basic information chart which includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cruise Speed: This is the cruise speed of the aircraft shown in Flight Points (FPs).
        \item Climb Speed: The optimum climb speed of the aircraft shown in FPs.
        \item Visibility: This is a visibility rating number referenced for sighting attempts against the aircraft.
        \item Size: This is the size modifier used as an enemy “to hit" die roll modifier in combat.
        \item Vulnerability: This is the vulnerability modifier used as a damage die roll modifier.
        \item Restricted Arc: This defines the aircraft's angle-off arc into which it can sight enemies only with difficulty.
        \item Blind Arc: This defines the aircraft's angle-off arc into which it cannot sight enemies.
        \item Internal Fuel: This is the maximum quantity of internal fuel, in terms of points, that can be carried by the aircraft.
        \item Ata Refuel: The yes or no indicates whether or not the aircraft can refuel from aerial tankers in flight.
        \item Ejection Seat: This lists the type of egress system carried by the aircraft; either none, early, standard or advanced ejection seats.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \itemparagraph{Maneuver Costs.} The Maneuver Costs Chart shows the cost, in terms of Flight Points and Decel Points, to perform lag rolls, displacement rolls, and vertical rolls. The cost is paid each time one of these maneuvers is performed.

    \item \itemparagraph{Power Chart.} The Power Chart indicates the maximum number of Accel Points available to the aircraft in a single game turn when a specific power setting is selected for the aircraft's engines. Three columns appear, one for each possible configuration of the aircraft. \changedin{2A}{2A:idle,2A:spbr,2A:fp-to-dp}{Also shown is the speed loss (in FPs) for selecting idle power and/or speedbrakes, and the fuel points used at each power setting.}{\par Also shown is the deceleration in DPs for selecting idle power and/or speedbrakes. (In earlier ADCs, these rows are labeled “Idle FP” and “Spbr.\ FP”, and the values should be doubled to obtain the corresponding number of DPs.) \par The last column shows the fuel points used at each power setting.}

    Note: The dots to the right of the Power Chart heading indicate the number of engines the aircraft has.

    \item \itemparagraph{Minimum-Maximum Velocity Chart.} The Minimum-Maximum Velocity Chart shows the minimum and maximum allowed speeds of the aircraft (in terms of Flight Points) in each altitude band by configuration. The Dive Speed column indicates the maximum speed (in Flight Points) allowed regardless of aircraft's configuration after a turn of Diving flight. The maximum ceiling, in altitude levels, that can be climbed to in each configuration is also indicated here.

    \item \itemparagraph{Turn Drag Chart.} The Turn Drag Chart shows the decel points received by an aircraft each game turn when using one of the listed turn rates. Three columns appear, one for each possible configuration. Appropriate notes are shown for the Turn Drag Chart if necessary.

    \item \itemparagraph{Climb Capability Chart.} The Climb Capability Chart (CCC) shows the maximum number of altitude levels an aircraft can gain in a single game turn at the Sustained Climb decel rate while in afterburner power or any other power in each altitude band for each possible configuration.

\end{enumerate}

Note: The game terms “configuration”, “accel point”, “decel point”, “flight point", and “angle-off arcs” may seem foreign to you at this moment. Do not be alarmed, each term will be clearly explained and its game function defined in upcoming chapters. Please read on.

\subsection{Combat Capabilities Panel}

The Combat Capabilities Panel is the lower half of the ADC and contains information about the combat abilities of the aircraft.  The panel is divided into the following sections.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

    \item \itemparagraph{Radar Data.} The Radar section indicates the characteristics of the aircraft's radar system. The search and tracking ranges are described in terms of hexes of distance. The functions of radar arcs, ECCM numbers and lock-on numbers are described in the radar rules.

    \item \itemparagraph{ECM Data.} The ECM section shows the types of electronic counter-measures gear, if any, the aircraft carries. ECM gear is identified by type (i.e., RWR = radar warning receiver) and quality. A dash indicates no gear of that type is present. A letter indicates gear is present and also indicates the relative quality of the equipment, (i.e., A = least capable, B and C = improved gear, and D = best). The number after the letter is its capability rating as explained in the ECM rules.

    \item \itemparagraph{Internal Gun Data.} The Internal Gun section shows the characteristics of the aircraft's internal guns if any. The data is fully explained in the gun combat rules (Rule 9).

    \item \itemparagraph{Bomb System.} The Bomb System section lists the kind of bombsight carried and the attack die roll modifier it provides when the aircraft does air to ground attacks.

    \item \itemparagraph{Technology Listing.} The Technology section lists the kinds of technology, if any, available to the aircraft. The effects on play of having a listed technology is defined in the appropriate rules sections.

    \item \itemparagraph{Weapons Stations Diagram.} The Weapon Stations Diagram identifies (by number) the aircraft's weapons pylons or internal bays. These weapons stations are where bombs, missiles, and other stores are attached to the aircraft. At the start of play, each aircraft should have its load of weapons and stores recorded on paper to facilitate keeping track of changes in the load as weapons are expended.

    \item \itemparagraph{Configuration Points Limits.} This section indicates what configuration an aircraft will be in when carrying a given amount of weapons and/or other loads. Every weapon, fuel tank, or store that can be carried is given a point value called its “load point rating” (see the associated weapons tables). These load points represent the weight and drag penalty that the item imposes on an aircraft when carried.

    The sum of the load an aircraft is carrying at any instant, in load points (rounded down), is compared to the limits given for the three possible configurations (CL = clean, 1/2 = half dirty, DT = Dirty). Where the sum falls within those limits defines the current configuration of the aircraft. See advanced rule 4.3.

    Internal Weapons Bays Note:  All weapons or stores carried in an aircraft's internal weapons bay count for only half the normal load value since no drag is imposed on the airplane.

    Basic Rules Note:  Use Only the CL Conf. Data. The term “configuration” refers to the relative load an aircraft is carrying. At the basic level of play aircraft are always considered to be “CL” or “Clean” configured. Players need only refer to the information under the "CL" sections of the ADC. They need not worry about changes in configuration, nor about load points or about information under the “1/2” or “DT” columns.

    \item \itemparagraph{Load Limit.} The load limit shown for the aircraft, in pounds, is the maximum weight of weapons and stores it can carry. All weapons and other stores listed in the game have a weight shown for them in the weapons charts. The aircraft's load may never exceed this amount even if the sum of all its station limits might be higher.

    \item \itemparagraph{Station Limits.} Each weapons station is limited in the amount of weight it can carry. This section lists each station's weight limit, and the types of ordnance and equipment which can be placed on the station. The types of loads that may be placed on each station are indicated in letter codes (i.e., BB = Ballistic Bombs, RP = Rocket Pods, etc.). The listed codes correspond to the codes given in the weapons tables.

    \item \itemparagraph{Notes and Variants.} The Notes and Variants section may contain additional comments about the aircraft and its capabilities. When a significant variant aircraft type is available, its differences from the basic ADC are shown.

    \item \itemparagraph{Victory Points.} The number of scenario victory points awarded to the enemy for achieving a level of damage against that aircraft is shown here. The four numbers are for K, C, H, and L damage levels respectively (Killed, Crippled, Heavy, and Light).

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Aircraft Configuration}

An aircraft carrying a load of bombs or other stores under its wings is less streamlined, and significantly heavier than a similar aircraft which is not. As a consequence, its performance will suffer in proportion to the load it carries. This is reflected through the concept of aircraft configuration.

\paragraph{Configuration.} Aircraft can be flown in one of three possible game configurations: Clean (CL), Half Dirty (1/2), and Dirty (DT). The actual configuration is determined by the amount of load points carried on the aircraft's weapons stations.  Each Aircraft Data Card indicates the point limits which establish Clean, Half, and Dirty. When adding up the load, first total all points then round any fractions \changedin{1B}{1B:apj-23-errata}{off}{down}.

\paragraph{Clean (CL).} An aircraft in clean configuration is unencumbered by external ordnance or equipment (it may carry some external equipment, but not enough to produce appreciable drag). Generally, the data cards are rated so that fighters can carry a normal load of missiles without penalty.

\paragraph{Half (1/2).} An aircraft in half configuration is midway between the lack of drag of Clean and the full drag of Dirty. Usually, adding a drop tank, and/or ECM pods or a small load of bombs is enough to cause a fighter to be half-loaded.

\paragraph{Dirty (DT).} An aircraft in Dirty configuration experiences substantial drag from external add-ons. Carrying a large load of ordnance and/or drop tanks will suffice to cause a fighter to be considered Dirty. You will note, that DT configured aircraft have lower speeds, less power, and suffer more Decel penalties while maneuvering than lesser configured aircraft.

\paragraph{Changes in Configuration.} An aircraft's configuration is never fixed, and will change during play as weapons are expended in attacks or jettisoned as the situation warrants. Changes in configuration take effect the instant enough load is disposed of to allow the point total to fall within a lesser limit.

Changes in configuration effect several aspects of play and are handled as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Power Available: Configuration changes can only occur after the power setting is selected, so no increase in Accel is available until the following turn.

    \itemaddedin{2B}{AWF}{Cruise Speed. If idle or normal power is selected, the determination of the cruise speed uses the configuration at the start of a game turn.}

    \item When Turning: The turn drag decel points an aircraft receives for turning is that for the configuration which existed when the highest turn rate was used that game turn.

    \item When Climbing: The climb rate allowed is that of the configuration which exists when the aircraft expends its first VFP during the game turn.

\end{itemize}

\addedin{1B}{1B:apj-23-errata}{\paragraph{Over-Loading Stations.} An aircraft may overload any of its weapon stations in terms of weight by up to 20\%. However, its maximum turn capability is reduced by one (i.e., from BT to HT) until all overloaded stations are back within limits. Though stations may be overloaded, the aircraft's total load limit may never be exceeded.}

\addedin{1B}{1B:apj-23-errata}{\paragraph{Symmetric Loading Requirements.} When picking loads for aircraft, the initial weight carried on one wing must be within 20\% of that carried on the other wind unless the total weight on each wing is 10\% or less of the aircraft's load limit.}

Configuration Example: An aircraft with the following configuration limits: CL = 0-8, 1/2 = 9-14, and DT = 15+; that is loaded with two Triple Racks (TRs) and six Mk.82 500lb HE bombs, is carrying 11 load points and would be 1/2 configured. The TRs are worth one load point each and the bombs are 1.5 points each. If a 1200L fuel tank were added (4 load points), the aircraft would be considered DT configured (15 points total).

\subsection{Jettisoning Weapons and Stores}

Aircraft may voluntarily jettison weapons and/or stores to change configuration, or may be required to jettison them due to combat damage. If voluntary, the player may selectively choose which weapons/stores, and how many, are jettisoned. If a required action due to damage, enough weapons and/or stores, player's choice, must be jettisoned to allow the aircraft to become CL configured.

\paragraph{Jettison Procedure.} Weapons and/or stores may be jettisoned by simply announcing the act during an aircraft's move. The configuration change takes effect immediately after the aircraft's next expenditure of an FP in movement.
