\label{rule:changing-aircraft-speed}

\x{
Aircraft speed can change during play as a result of using various power settings, and as a result of doing climbs, dives, turns and maneuvers. To keep things simple, an aircraft's start speed is used as its speed for an entire game turn. Activities which may affect that speed, are noted in the log as the aircraft moves and any speed changes which result are determined after the aircraft completes its move. The changed speed is logged in the next turn as the aircraft's new start speed.

\section{Power Settings}
\label{rule:power-settings}

In the game, aircraft engines produce thrust in terms of accel points; how many depends on the aircraft's chosen power setting and current configuration. At the beginning of each aircraft's move, the player must select one of the four allowed power settings. If a new setting is not selected, the setting from the previous turn remains in effect. Note the selected power setting code on the Power line of the Log.

\paragraph{Power Settings.} The four power settings are: Idle, Normal, Military, and Afterburner (Codes: I, N, M, and AB).

\begin{itemize}
    \item\itemparagraph{Idle.} \changedin{2A}{2A-idle}{This is the minimum setting that will keep a jet engine functioning; it provides no accel points, but on the turn in which Idle power is selected, the aircraft start speed is immediately reduced by the FP amount shown on the power chart. (This is the only game action that will change an aircraft's speed within the same game turn before it moves.)}{Idle power is the minimum setting that will keep a jet engine functioning. Selecting idle power incurs the DPs for the aircraft's configuration given in the idle power row of the power chart on the ADC.}

    \addedin{2A}{2A-idle,2A-fp-to-dp}{
    (In earlier ADCs, the idle power row is labeled “Idle FP” rather than “Idle Dec.”, and the values should be doubled to obtain the corresponding number of DPs.)
    }

    \item\itemparagraph{Normal.} Normal power is an economic setting used to conserve fuel and increase range. Normal power provides enough thrust to maintain an aircraft's current speed if that speed is equal to or less than its listed cruise speed and no drag producing maneuvers or climbs are performed. No accel points are received.

    \item\itemparagraph{Military.} Military power is the maximum setting for a jet engine not having an Afterburner. Selecting Military power provides Accel points which can result in increased speed when sufficient points are accumulated. The minimum in Accel points that can be taken in Military (unless damaged) is \changedin{2B}{2B-military}{0.5}{0.0}; the maximum is the value shown on the Power Setting Chart for the aircraft's configuration.  The player may select any value of accel points within that range. Write the amount in the Accel line of the Log.

    \item\itemparagraph{Afterburner.} Afterburners provide increased thrust by dumping extra fuel directly into a jet engine's tailpipe to create a blowtorch effect. This provides extra thrust at a great cost in fuel consumption. Afterburner power provides more accel points than Military. The minimum Accel points a player may take while in AB is maximum Military power plus 0.5; the maximum allowed is the value shown on the Power Setting Chart. The player may select any value of accel points within that range. Aircraft not equipped with an afterburner have dashes instead of numbers.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rapid Power Response.} An aircraft is normally limited in its ability to increase its power setting from turn to turn. Normal aircraft may safely increase power by one or two levels per game turn. For example, power may be increased from Idle to Military, but not from Idle to Afterburner. Aircraft may decrease their power setting without limit. Aircraft noted as being Rapid Power Response capable on their ADC are unrestricted and may increase power any amount each turn. Normal aircraft may increase power from Idle to Afterburner at the risk of flaming out (see 6.7).

\paragraph{Decel Point Penalty for Insufficient Power.} If an aircraft selects Idle or Normal power, and its speed is greater than its listed Cruise speed, it incurs one Decel point in addition to any others received that turn.

\section{Acceleration \& Deceleration Points}
}{
\section{Acceleration and Deceleration Points}
}
\label{rule:acceleration-and-deceleration-points}

\x{
Aircraft speed will increase or decrease as a result of the accel points and decel points it accumulates in a game-turn. \addedin{1C}{1C-tables}{Table~\ref{table:acceleration} summarizes the sources of APs and DPs, and the details are given in the corresponding sections of these rules.}
}{
An aircraft's speed will increase or decrease due to the acceleration points (APs) and deceleration points (DPs) it accumulates in a game turn. Table~\ref{table:acceleration} summarizes the sources of APs and DPs, and the corresponding sections of these rules give details. Do not confuse FPs with APs and DPs; FPs measure speed, whereas APs and DPs determine how much the speed changes.
}

\x{
\paragraph{Accel Points.} Accel points represent the energy gain from high power settings and/or from diving flight. Accel points gained will cancel an equal number of any decel points gained.
}{
\paragraph{Acceleration Points.} Acceleration points (APs) represent the energy gain from high engine power and diving flight. APs cancel an equal number of DPs.
}

\x{
\paragraph{Decel Points.} Decel points represent the energy lost due to using low power settings, aircraft maneuvering, and/or climbing flight. The advanced rules discuss additional sources of decel points. Decel points will cancel an equal number of any accel points gained.
}{
\paragraph{Deceleration Points.} Deceleration points (DPs) represent the energy lost from low engine power, turning, maneuvering, and climbing flight. The advanced rules discuss additional sources of DPs. DPs cancel an equal number of APs.
}

\paragraph{Speed Change Determination Procedure.} When an aircraft completes its move, it may have received both accel and decel points. Note the totals of each, then subtract any decel points from accel points. If the result is 0.0, there is no change in aircraft speed for the turn and you can ignore all following steps. If the result is positive, the aircraft may gain speed (accelerate). If the result is negative, the aircraft may lose speed (decelerate).

\paragraph{Speed Gain.}
\x{
Add 0.5 to the aircraft's current speed for each 2.0 accel points left after subtracting decel.  Any unused Accel points (up to 1.5) are carried forward to the next game turn and will be added to any accel points received in that turn.

Example: An aircraft accumulating 6.0 accel points and 3.0 decel has a net accel of 3.0. Two of those accel are used to increase its speed by 0.5 and the rest is carried to the next turn.
}{
Add 0.5 to the aircraft's speed for every 2.0 APs left after subtracting the DPs. Any leftover APs (up to 1.5) are carried forward to the next game turn and will be added to any APs received in that game turn.

Example: An aircraft has accumulated 6.0 APs and 3.0 DPs and so has a net of $+3.0$. Its speed is increased by 0.5, and 1.0 AP is carried forward to the next game turn.
}

\paragraph{Speed Loss.} 
\x{
Subtract 0.5 from the aircraft's current speed for each 2.0 decel points left. Any unused decel points (up to 1.5) are carried forward to the next game turn and will be added to any decel points received in that turn.

Example: An aircraft accumulating 2.5 accel and 5.0 decel has a net accel of $-2.5$, or in other terms has 2.5 decel left over. Two of those decel are used to reduce its speed by 0.5. The remaining 0.5 decel is carried to the next game turn.
}{
Subtract 0.5 from the aircraft's speed for every 2.0 DPs left after subtracting APs. Any leftover DPs (up to 1.5) are carried forward to the next game turn and will be added to any DPs received in that game turn.

Example: An aircraft has accumulated 2.5 APs and 5.0 DPs and so has a net of $-2.5$. Its speed is reduced by 0.5, and 0.5 DP is carried forward to the next game turn.
}

\addedin{1C}{1C-tables}{
    \input{tables/table-acceleration}
}

\paragraph{Maximum Deceleration.} 
\x{
Regardless of the number of decel points accumulated in a turn, no aircraft can end up with a start speed of less than 0.0. When an aircraft's speed reaches 0.0, all remaining Decel points are ignored and considered lost.
}{
Regardless of the number of DPs accumulated in a game turn, an aircraft cannot end with a start speed of less than 0.0. When an aircraft's speed reaches 0.0, all remaining DPs are ignored and considered lost.
}

\paragraph{New Start Speed.} 
\x{
The sum of the aircraft's current speed plus any speed gain or loss at the end of its flight becomes the aircraft's start speed for the next game turn. Accel and decel points are almost always received in steps of 0.5 points. If the aircraft is damaged, power setting points may be halved, and consequently they may produce fractional steps of accel or decel points. In order to keep the math simple, no fraction of less than 0.25 is ever used in play.
}{
The sum of the aircraft's current speed plus any speed gain or loss at the end of its flight becomes the aircraft's new start speed for the next game turn. 
}

\x{
\paragraph{Rapid Accel Aircraft.} An aircraft noted on its ADC as being Rapid Accel capable is considered to be an exceptionally clean design which speeds up quicker than normal. This kind of aircraft receives a speed increase of 0.5 FP for each 1.5 accel points instead of each 2.0. It decelerates normally.

Example: A rapid accel aircraft gaining 6.0 accel points and 2.0 decel points in a turn, would gain 1.0 of speed. Its net accel is 4.0 ($6.0 - 2.0$). Each 1.5 of Accel gains 0.5 speed so 3.0 Accel is good for the 1.0 speed increase and the left over 1.0 Accel would be carried to the next game turn.
}{
\paragraph{Rapid Acceleration Aircraft.} If an ADC notes that an aircraft has rapid acceleration (RA), it is considered to be an exceptionally clean design that speeds up quicker than normal. This kind of aircraft receives a speed increase of 0.5 FP for each 1.5 APs instead of each 2.0. It decelerates normally.

Example: An RA aircraft has accumulated 6.0 APs and 2.0, and so has a net of $+4.0$. Its speed is increased by 1.0, and 1.0 AP is carried forward to the next game turn.
}
\Dx{
Reminder:  Do not confuse Accel and Decel points with \changedin{1B}{1B-apj-23-errata}{speed}{flight} points. They are separate things.
}

\Ax{
\paragraph{Fractional APs.} APs and DPs points are almost always received in steps of 0.5. If the aircraft is damaged, its engine power APs may be halved, and so it might receive APs in steps of 0.25.
}

\Ax{
\section{Engine Thrust}
\label{rule:engine-thrust}

In the game, the thrust produced by an aircraft's engines results in the aircraft gaining APs; how many depends on the aircraft's chosen power setting and current configuration. At the beginning of each aircraft's move, the player must select one of the four allowed power settings. If a new setting is not selected, the setting from the previous game turn remains in effect. Note the selected power setting code on the power line of the aircraft log.

\paragraph{Power Settings.} The four power settings and their codes are: idle (I), normal (N), military (M), and afterburner (AB).

\begin{itemize}
    \item\itemparagraph{Idle.} Idle power is the minimum setting that will keep a jet engine functioning. An aircraft using idle power receives the DPs given in the idle power row of the power chart on the ADC for the aircraft's configuration.

    (In earlier ADCs, the idle power row is labeled “Idle FP” rather than “Idle Dec.”, and the values should be doubled to obtain the corresponding number of DPs.)

    \item\itemparagraph{Normal.} Normal power is an economic setting used to conserve fuel and increase range. It provides enough thrust to maintain an aircraft's current speed up to its cruise speed, provided no drag-producing turns, maneuvers, or climbs are performed. No APs are received.

    \item\itemparagraph{Military.} Military power is the maximum setting for a jet engine without using an afterburner. It provides APs which can result in increased speed when sufficient points are accumulated. The aircraft gains any amount of APs between a minimum of 0.0 and the maximum shown on the power chart on the ADC for the aircraft's configuration. Write the amount in the AP line of the aircraft.

    \item\itemparagraph{Afterburner.} Afterburners increase thrust by dumping extra fuel directly into a jet engine's tailpipe to create a blowtorch effect. This provides extra thrust at a great cost in fuel consumption. Afterburner power provides more APs than military power. The aircraft gains any amount of APs between a minimum of 0.5 more than the maximum for military power and the maximum shown on the power chart on the ADC for the aircraft's configuration. Write the amount in the AP line of the aircraft. Aircraft not equipped with an afterburner have dashes instead of numbers.


\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Changing Power Settings.}\label{rule:rapid-power-response} An aircraft is normally limited in increasing its power setting from game turn to game turn. Normal aircraft may safely increase power by one or two levels per game turn. For example, they may safely increase power from idle to military but not from idle to afterburner. If an ADC notes that an aircraft has rapid power response (RPR),  it may safely increase power by any amount each turn. Normal aircraft may increase power from idle to afterburner at the risk of flaming out (see rule~\ref{rule:engine-flame-outs}). Aircraft may decrease their power setting without limit. 

\paragraph{Insufficient Power Above Cruise Speed.} If an aircraft uses idle or normal power, and its speed exceeds its listed cruise speed, it receives one DP in addition to any others received that turn.

}

\section{Speed Limits}
\label{rule:speed-limits}

\x{
Aircraft are restricted in the minimum and maximum speeds they may use.
}{
Aircraft are restricted in the speeds they may use in normal flight. The minimum-maximum velocity chart (MMVC) of the ADC shows the limits in each altitude band for each aircraft configuration.
}

\x{
\paragraph{Minimum Allowed Speed.} 
An aircraft must maintain a minimum speed or it will stall. The Minimum-Maximum Velocity Chart (MMVC) of the ADC shows the minimum allowed speeds in each altitude band for each aircraft configuration. This minimum speed is the smaller of the two numbers listed. An aircraft with a start speed below this minimum is stalled, and must check to see if it enters departed flight. Whether stalled or departed, it will use the abnormal flight procedures (see 6.4) instead of regular flight.
}{
\paragraph{Minimum Speed.} 
An aircraft must maintain a minimum speed, or it will stall. The MMVC shows the minimum allowed speed in each altitude band for each configuration. This minimum speed is the smaller of the two numbers listed. An aircraft with a start speed below this minimum is stalled and must check to see if it enters departed flight. Whether stalled or departed, it will use the abnormal flight procedures (see rule~\ref{rule:abnormal-flight}) instead of normal flight.
}

\x{
\paragraph{Maximum Allowed Speed.} The Minimum-Maximum Velocity Chart shows the maximum allowed speed for the aircraft by altitude band and configuration for level or climbing flight. The Dive Speed column indicates the maximum speed allowed (regardless of configuration) after a turn of diving.

\paragraph{Acceleration Limits.} If an aircraft is in level or climbing flight, Accel points that would push it beyond its maximum speed on the MMVC (for the altitude band in which it ends its flight) are unusable and ignored. If an aircraft in level or climbing flight is at its maximum speed, up to 1.5 Accel points \addedin{2B}{2B-raa}{(1.0 for RA aircraft) }may be carried forward; excess Accel are lost (because they would accelerate the aircraft beyond its maximum speed).

If an aircraft is in diving flight, it may use accel points to accelerate beyond the maximum speed on the MMVC up to the indicated dive speed (for the altitude band in which it ends its flight); configuration has no effect on dive speed. If an aircraft in diving flight is at its dive speed, up to 1.5 accel points \addedin{2B}{2B-raa}{(1.0 for RA aircraft) }may be carried forward; excess accel points are lost (because they would accelerate the aircraft beyond its dive speed.)

}{
\paragraph{Maximum and Dive Speed.} The MMVC shows the maximum speed by altitude band and configuration and the dive speed by altitude band (regardless of configuration).

If an aircraft is in level flight, climbing flight, or diving flight in which it only loses one altitude level, then APs that would increase its speed beyond the maximum speed (for the altitude band in which it ends its flight) are ignored. If the aircraft has APs that would increase its speed beyond the maximum speed, up to 1.5 APs (1.0 APs for RA aircraft) may be carried forward to the next game turn, and any excess APs beyond these are lost.

If an aircraft is in diving flight in which it loses more than one altitude level, it may use APs to accelerate beyond the maximum speed up to the dive speed (for the altitude band in which it ends its flight). If the aircraft has APs that would increase its speed beyond the dive speed, up to 1.5 APs (1.0 APs for RA aircraft) may be carried forward to the next turn, and any excess APs beyond these are lost.
}

\x{
\paragraph{Exceeding Level and Climbing Speed Limits.} An aircraft choosing level or climbing flight may, if the previous turn involved diving, have a start speed greater than its maximum speed on the MMVC. If at the end of the non-diving turn, after accel/decel effects are determined, the speed still exceeds maximum allowed, a speed fadeback is performed. (This situation can occur after an aircraft has accelerated above its maximum speed during diving flight.)

\paragraph{Speed Fadeback.} If a new start speed is determined to still be illegal, it must be reduced a further 1.0 or to the aircraft's maximum speed, whichever is greater.

Fadeback Example: An aircraft which dove on the previous turn has a start speed of 12.0 which is in its allowed dive speed range. It chooses level flight, where its maximum allowed speed is 9.0, and maneuvers such that its power accel nearly balances decel. At the end of its move it loses 0.5 speed due to decel. Its new start speed is 11.5, still greater than its maximum level so a fadeback penalty applies reducing its new start speed to 10.5. In the new turn it stays level accumulating only enough decel to lose 1.0 speed. The subsequent start speed is 9.5, still above the limit of 9.0, so a fadeback applies, again reducing speed to 9.0.
}{
\paragraph{Exceeding Maximum Speed.} If at the end of its move, an aircraft in level flight, climbing flight, or diving flight in which it only loses one altitude level has a new start speed that exceeds its maximum speed, it suffers a speed fadeback, which reduces its speed by 1.0 or to the aircraft's maximum speed, whichever is greater.

Example: An aircraft dived several levels on the previous game turn and has a start speed of 12.0, which does not exceed its dive speed. It chooses level flight, for which its maximum speed is 9.0, and at the end of its move loses 0.5 speed due to DPs. Its new start speed is 11.5, which is greater than its maximum level, and so a fadeback occurs that reduces its new start speed to 10.5. In the next game turn, the aircraft continues in level flight, and at the end of its move loses 1.0 speed due to DPs. Its new start speed is 9.5, still above the maximum of 9.0, so another fadeback occurs that reduces the new start speed to 9.0.
}

\x{
\paragraph{Diving Speed Limits.} An aircraft in diving flight may never have a start speed greater than its dive speed on the MMVC. If (at the end of its move) its new start speed would be higher than its allowed dive speed, its start speed is automatically reduced to maximum dive speed. This usually occurs when an aircraft enters a new altitude band having a lesser dive speed.
}{
\paragraph{Exceeding Dive Speed.} An aircraft in diving flight may never have a new start speed greater than its dive speed. If, at the end of its move, its new start speed is higher than its dive speed, the new start speed is reduced to the dive speed. (This situation can occur when an aircraft enters a new altitude band with a lower dive speed.)
}

\section{Abnormal Flight (Stalls and Departures)}
\label{rule:abnormal-flight}

\addedin{1C}{1C-tables}{
    \input{tables/table-departed-flight}
}

\x{
An aircraft which does not maintain sufficient speed stalls. A stalled aircraft rapidly loses altitude, but remains under minimal control. A stalled aircraft has a chance of going out of control meaning it departs controlled flight, in which it tumbles or spins uncontrollably earthward until it crashes or the pilot regains control.

It has a chance of going out of control and entering a departed flight. If it does, it tumbles or spins uncontrollably earthward until it crashes or the pilot regains control.
}

\paragraph{Check for Departed Flight.} 
\x{
If the Start speed for an aircraft is less than its minimum allowed speed at the beginning of a turn, the aircraft is stalled. All stalled aircraft must check to see if they depart from controlled flight. During the Stalled Aircraft Phase, roll the die once for each stalled aircraft and apply any appropriate modifiers \changedin{1C}{1C-tables}{(see play aid tables)}{from Table~\ref{table:departed-flight-avoidance}}. If the result is 5 or less, the aircraft enters Departed Flight; otherwise, it remains in Stalled Flight.
}{
If the start speed of an aircraft is less than its minimum speed, it is stalled. All stalled aircraft must check to see if they depart from controlled flight. During the stalled aircraft phase, roll the die once for each stalled aircraft and apply any appropriate modifiers \changedin{1C}{1C-tables}{(see play aid tables)}{from Table~\ref{table:departed-flight-avoidance}}. On a result of $5-$, the aircraft enters departed flight; otherwise, it remains in stalled flight.
}

\paragraph{Stalled Flight Procedure.} 
\x{
Aircraft in stalled flight may not change map location or facing. An aircraft in stalled flight loses altitude levels equal to its start speed FPs plus one for each turn it remains stalled (round 0.5 up). The aircraft receives 0.5 accel points per altitude level lost on the first game turn of the stall (in subsequent game turns, it receives 1.0 Accel points per altitude level lost). Accel points may also be received from the aircraft power setting.
}{
An aircraft in stalled flight does not change its map location or facing, but loses altitude levels equal to its start speed in FPs (rounded up) plus one for each game turn it is stalled (i.e., plus one on the first game turn, plus two on the second, and so on). The aircraft receives 0.5 APs per altitude level lost on the first game turn of the stall and 1.0 APs per altitude level lost on subsequent game turns. APs may also be received from engine thrust.
}

\paragraph{Ending A Stall.} 
\x{
An aircraft will exit stalled flight at the beginning of the first turn in which its start speed is no longer less than its current minimum speed (which may have changed from the original stall speed due to altitude loss, or configuration change). Upon exiting the stall, the aircraft may only perform level flight or diving flight. It may go directly into a vertical dive if desired. \addedin{1B}{1B-apj-34-qa}{Any carried half FP is lost.} \addedin{2B}{2B-stalled}{The aircraft has a wings-level attitude.}

Upon exiting the stall, the aircraft may only perform level flight or diving flight. It may go directly into a vertical dive if desired. Any carried half FP is lost. The aircraft has a wings-level attitude.
}

\paragraph{Configuration Effects.}
\x{
Configuration has an effect on stall speed. An aircraft may jettison external stores in order to reduce its configuration from DT to 1/2 or CL, or from 1/2 to CL. This change in configuration may change the aircraft's stall speed helping it to recover sooner.
}{
An aircraft may jettison external stores to reduce its configuration from DT to 1/2 or CL or from 1/2 to CL. This may change the aircraft's stall speed, helping it recover sooner.
}

\paragraph{Departed Flight Procedure.} 
\x{
An aircraft in Departed Flight remains in Departed Flight until it executes a successful recovery. While departed, the aircraft's facing randomly changes as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Roll the die once to determine direction of facing change. Odd results change the facing left; even results change the facing right.

    \item Roll the die again; the result is the number of facing changes in the designated direction. If the aircraft is on a hexside, shift it to the adjacent hex in the direction of its facing changes even if it reverses direction. Departed aircraft do not otherwise change their map location.

    \item An aircraft in departed flight loses altitude levels equal to its start speed FPs plus two for each turn of departed flight (round 0.5 up).

\end{itemize}

Aircraft speed cannot be changed while in departed flight and all accel/decel points are ignored. Power setting does not aid recovery or affect speed. Aircraft that enter departed flight with a power setting of A/B or military risk flame-out.
}{
An aircraft in departed flight remains in departed flight until it executes a successful recovery. 

While departed, the aircraft changes facing randomly as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Roll the die once to determine the direction of the facing change. Odd results change the facing left and even results change the facing right.

    \item Roll the die again. The result is the number of 30{\deg} facing changes in the designated direction. If the aircraft is on a hex side, shift it to the adjacent hex in the direction of its facing changes even if it reverses direction. Departed aircraft do not otherwise change their map location.

\end{itemize}

An aircraft in departed flight loses altitude levels equal to its start speed in FPs (rounded up) plus two for each game turn it is departed (i.e., plus two on the first game turn, plus four on the second, and so on)

The aircraft's speed does not change while in departed flight, and all APs and DPs points are ignored. Engine thrust does not aid recovery or change the speed. Aircraft that enter departed flight with a power setting of afterburner or military risk a flame-out.
}

\paragraph{Recovering From Departed Flight.} 
\x{
During the Stalled Aircraft phase of each turn, each departed aircraft checks to see if it recovers from departed flight. Roll a die and apply any appropriate modifiers\addedin{1C}{1C-tables}{\ according to Table~\ref{table:departed-flight-recovery}}. If the result is 6 or less, the aircraft recovers; otherwise, it remains in departed flight.

If the aircraft recovers, it may resume normal flight. Start speed is automatically minimum speed (from the MMVC) or the speed at which it departed (whichever is greater). On the turn of recovery, an aircraft may only choose diving flight (vertical dives are allowed). Exception: a High Pitch Rate capable aircraft may choose level flight. \addedin{1B}{1B-apj-35-qa}{The aircraft recovers to a wings level attitude.} \addedin{1B}{1B-apj-34-qa}{Any carried half FP is lost.} \addedin{2B}{2B-departed}{Any carried APs or DPs are lost.}

During the stalled aircraft phase of each game turn, each departed aircraft checks to see if it recovers from departed flight. Roll a die and apply any appropriate modifiers\addedin{1C}{1C-tables}{\ from Table~\ref{table:departed-flight-recovery}}. If the result is $6-$, the aircraft recovers; otherwise, it remains in departed flight.

If the aircraft recovers, it may resume normal flight. Its start speed is its minimum speed or the speed at which it departed, whichever is greater. On the turn of recovery, an aircraft may only choose diving flight, including a vertical dive, unless it is an HPR aircraft, in which case it can also choose level flight. The aircraft recovers to a wings-level attitude. Any carried half FP is lost. Any carried APs or DPs are lost.

\section{Speedbrakes}
\label{rule:speedbrakes}

\changedin{2A}{2A-spbr,2A-fp-to-dp}{

Most jet aircraft are equipped with speedbrakes. Speedbrakes may be applied once per game turn, at any point in an aircraft's flight, to burn off FPs.  Speedbrakes (when applied) expend FPs up to the amount listed on the speedbrake (SPBR) row of the power chart of the ADC without actually moving the aircraft.

The FPs burned may be either HFPs, or VFPs if in climbing or diving flight. FPs burned by speedbrakes simply go away; they may not be counter toward any required expenditure of FPs such as those for doing turning flight, maneuvers, proportional moves, or combat. \addedin{1B}{1B-apj-36-errata}{Speedbrakes may not be used to eliminate the only VFP of a climb or dive, or the only unloaded HFP in an unloaded dive. They may, in general, be used to eliminate a VFP in a vertical climb or dive.}

\addedin{1B}{1B-apj-36-errata}{Aircraft with a fractional number of FP burn off the fraction first with the speed brakes. It is not possible to carry two 0.5 FP into the next game-turn.}

\addedin{1B}{1B-apj-36-errata}{FPs burned by speedbrakes may not contribute to a recovery period, nor do they satisfy SSGT or ground attack aiming requirements. They may be used to eliminate HFPs required when switching from a dive to a climb or vice versa, and VFPs or unloaded HFPs mandated after a vertical dive.}

\paragraph{Decel Penalty for Speedbrake Use.} The aircraft receives one decel point for each 0.5 FP burned in speedbraking.

}{

Most jet aircraft are equipped with speedbrakes. Speedbrakes may be applied once per game turn, at any point in an aircraft's movement, to burn off energy and receive DPs up to the maximum listed on the speedbrake row of the power chart on the ADC.  The deceleration from speedbrakes is in addition to any other DPs received by the aircraft.

(In earlier ADCs, the speedbrake row is labeled “Spbr.\ FP” rather than “Spbr.\ Dec.”, and the values should be doubled to obtain the corresponding number of DPs.)

The speed of sound is referred to as Mach 1.0 (M1). Speeds just under the speed of sound are termed Transonic speeds. Speeds equal to or greater than M1 are termed Supersonic speeds. The actual game speeds that are considered Transonic or M1 vary by Altitude Band (The speed of sound decreases as air temperature decreases with increased altitude). These speeds are summarized in \changedin{1C}{1C-tables}{the Transonic/Supersonic Speed Reference Table}{Table~\ref{table:supersonic-speed}}.
}{
The speed of sound is called Mach 1.0 or M1. Speeds just under the speed of sound are transonic speeds, and those equal to or greater than the speed of sound are supersonic speeds. The actual game speeds considered transonic or supersonic vary by altitude band, as the speed of sound decreases as the air temperature decreases with increasing altitude. These speeds are given in Table~\ref{table:supersonic-speed}.
}

\paragraph{Transonic Speeds.} 
\x{
An aircraft with a start speed 1.0 less than M1 is considered to be at Low Transonic speed. Aircraft with a start speed 0.5 less than M1 are considered to be at High Transonic speed. Aircraft flying at Low Transonic speed, High Transonic speed, or at exactly M1 receive Transonic Decel point penalties. These are listed in \changedin{1C}{1C-tables}{the Transonic Drag Table}{Table~\ref{table:transonic-and-supersonic-drag}} and vary depending on whether the aircraft is a design which suffers from High Transonic Drag (HTD) or benefits from Low Transonic Drag (LTD) or is average (normal). The ADC will note if an aircraft is an HTD or LTD design.

\addedin{1B}{1B-apj-36-errata}{The decel for transonic or M1 speed is assessed at the start of the turn, based on the aircraft's starting speed and altitude.}
}{
An aircraft with a start speed 1.0 less than M1 is at low transonic speed. An aircraft with a start speed 0.5 less than M1 is at high transonic speed. 

\paragraph{Transonic and Mach One Drag.} An aircraft whose start speed is low transonic, high transonic, or exactly M1 at its starting altitude receives DPs according to Table~\ref{table:transonic-and-supersonic-drag}. 

If an aircraft's ADC notes that it has low transonic drag (LTD) or high transonic drag (HTD), the drag penalty is lower or higher than for normal aircraft. (Some earlier ADCs note that an aircraft is a “supersonic delta.” Such an aircraft is treated as having low transonic drag.)
}

\paragraph{Supersonic Speeds.}

An aircraft flying at M1 or faster is in supersonic flight and is subject to the following effects\addedin{1C}{1C-tables}{, which are summarized in Table~\ref{table:supersonic-penalties}}:

\section{Engine Flame-Outs}
\label{rule:engine-flame-outs}

\x{
Rapid throttle movements or uncontrolled yaw rates can flame-out jet engines which are at high power settings.
}{
A jet engine can suffer a flame-out if its air supply is disturbed or inadequate. This can be caused by using low engine power at supersonic speeds, rapid throttle movements, uncontrolled yaw rates, and excess altitude.
}

\begin{itemize}

    \item it is at Military or Afterburner power and in departed flight.

    \item it is not Rapid Power Response and changes power setting from Idle to Afterburner.

    \item it starts the turn above its maximum altitude ceiling and selects any power setting other than Idle.

\end{itemize}
}{
\paragraph{When Does A Jet Flame Out?} An aircraft may experience a flame-out if:

\begin{itemize}

    \item It receives a flame-out as the result of damage.

    \item It uses idle or normal power at supersonic speeds.

    \item It uses military or afterburner power in departed flight.

    \item It does not have rapid power response (RPR) and changes its power setting from idle to afterburner.

    \item Its starting altitude is above its maximum ceiling, and it selects any power setting other than idle.

\end{itemize}
}

\paragraph{Flame-Out Procedure.} 
\x{
\changedin{2A}{2A-supersonic-flame-out}{If an aircraft meets one of the above conditions}{In the first case, the flame-out is automatic. In the other cases}, roll a die for each engine at the start of its move. A flame-out occurs on a roll of 4 or less. Apply a die roll modifier of $-1$ for each turn an aircraft has been above its ceiling. If a flame-out is called for on the damage tables, it occurs automatically.

Note: The number of engines an aircraft has is indicated on the Power Chart by dots to the right of the chart title. One dot per engine is used.
}{
If the flame-out is caused by damage or supersonic speeds, the flame-out is automatic.  In the other cases, at the start of the aircraft's move, roll a die for each engine. A flame-out occurs on a roll of $4-$. In the last case, apply a die roll modifier of $-1$ for each game turn that an aircraft has been above its ceiling. The power chart in the ADC indicates the number of engines an aircraft has by dots. One dot is used per engine.
}
\x{
\paragraph{Effects of Flame-Out.} 
A single-engine jet is treated as if it is in Idle power. On multi-engine aircraft, if half (or less) of the engines flame-out, the aircraft produces half normal Accel points (keep fractions). If more than half (but not all) are flamed out, the aircraft produces 1/3 normal Accel points (drop fractions). If all engines are out, the aircraft is at idle power.
}{
\paragraph{Effects of Flame-Outs.} 
A single-engined aircraft is treated as using idle power.  For multi-engined aircraft, if half or less of the engines are flamed out, the aircraft receives half the normal APs (keep fractions). If more than half (but not all) are flamed out, the aircraft receives {\onethird} of normal APs (round down). If all the engines are flamed out, the aircraft is treated as using idle power.
}

\paragraph{Engine Relights.} 
\x{
Attempts to restart flamed out engines are allowed if an aircraft is not in abnormal flight and during its turn it performs or meets the same criteria as for performing Damage Control (see chapter 10). Roll a die once at the end of the aircraft's flight phase. On the first attempt, 2 or less indicates success; on the second and third attempts, 4 or less indicates success.

One attempt is allowed per engine per turn beginning on the game-turn following the flame-out. A maximum of three relight attempts per engine is allowed; if all three relight attempts are unsuccessful, the engine is permanently flamed out. (If in a single engine jet, the pilot might consider reading the ejection rules).
}{
A pilot can attempt to relight flamed-out engines. One attempt is allowed per engine per turn starting on the game turn following the flame-out. The aircraft must not be in abnormal flight and must meet the requirements for performing damage control (see rule~\ref{rule:progressive-damage}). At the end of the aircraft's move, roll a die. The attempt is successful on a roll of $2-$ on the first attempt and $4-$ on the second and third attempts.

A maximum of three relight attempts per engine are allowed; if all three attempts fail, the engine is permanently flamed out. (The pilot of a single-engine jet might consider reading rule~\ref{rule:ejections-and-bail-outs}.)

\addedin{2A}{2A-cruise}{\section{Realistic Cruise Speeds}

An aircraft's cruise speed depends on its configuration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If its configuration is CL, use the cruise speed given on its ADC.
    \item If its configuration is $1/2$, use the cruise speed on its ADC reduced by 0.5. 
    \item If its configuration is DT, use the cruise speed on its ADC reduced by 1.0.

\section{Loss of Thrust with Altitude}
\label{rule:loss-of-thrust-with-altitude}

Jet engines lose thrust in the thinner air at high altitudes. To reflect this, use the following:

\begin{itemize}

    \item In the VH band, engine thrust is 2/3 normal (but not less than 0.5).

    \item In the EH and UH bands, engine thrust is 1/3 normal (but not less than 0.5).

\end{itemize}

Use Table~\ref{table:fractions} to calculate the reduced thrust.

\paragraph{High-Altitude Engines.} Some aircraft have engines designed specially for high-altitude flight. If an ADC notes that an aircraft has high-altitude engines (HAE), it ignores this rule.
