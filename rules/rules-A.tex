\rulechapter{Range and Arcs}

The relative position of one aircraft or missile with respect to another is crucial for many aspects of air combat. 

This rule describes how the relative position is determined. The relative position has three components: the range, the horizontal arc, and the vertical arc. 

% including air-to-air gun and rocket attacks (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-gun-combat}), air-to-air missile launches, tracking, and attacks  (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-missiles}), visual sighting (rule~\ref{rule:sighting-aircraft-and-missiles}), advantage (rule~\ref{rule:initiative}), and radar detection, tracking, and illumination (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-radar}).

\section{Range}
\label{rule:range}

Many situations described in these rules depend on the \emph{range} from one element to another. For example, it is more difficult to sight or identify aircraft at longer range and radars often have a limited range.

Other than in the one exceptional case noted subsequently, the range in hexes from one element to another is determined using the following procedure.

\paragraph{Range Procedure.}
The range has two components, the horizontal range and the vertical range. They are determined and combined as follows:

\input{figures/figure-range}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The \emph{horizontal range} is the length of the shortest route between the map locations, measured in full hexes.

If both map locations are at hex centers, then the procedure is straightforward and familiar. However, if one or both are on hex sides, it may be less familiar. Figure~\ref{figure:range} shows map locations that are one full hex apart, including both hex centers and hex sides. 

Figure~\ref{figure:range} also shows locations that are less than one full hex apart. If the last step of the shortest route is less than one full hex, it is ignored.

Figure~\ref{figure:range-example} gives examples of horizontal ranges.

\item
The \emph{vertical range} is the difference in altitude levels divided by two and rounded down. That is, each two whole altitudes levels of difference counts as one unit of vertical range.

However, when sighting a \emph{higher} aircraft or missile in daylight, the vertical range is the difference in altitude levels divided by \emph{four} and rounded down (see rule~\ref{rule:sighting-aircraft-and-missiles}).

\item
The \emph{range} is the sum of the horizontal and the vertical ranges.
\end{itemize}

The horizontal range, vertical range, and range are always non-negative integers.

\paragraph{Range Exception.}
The normal range procedure is \emph{not} used for air-to-air gun attacks. Instead, the range is determined according to rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-gun-combat}.

\paragraph{Closeness.}
\label{rule:closeness}

Range is used to determine closeness. If two aircraft have different ranges from a reference element, the one with the smaller range is considered to be closer to the reference element. If two aircraft have the same range, they are considered to be equally close.

For example, assuming all the aircraft in Figure~\ref{figure:range-example} have the same altitude, then aircraft C and D are equally close to aircraft A, since both are at a range of 2 hexes. Furthermore, assuming that aircraft A and C are at the same altitude and aircraft D is one altitude level below or above, then aircraft C and D are still equally close to aircraft A since both are still at a range of 2 hexes.

\AY[3A-horizontal-arcs]{

\section{Horizontal Arcs}
\label{rule:horizontal-arcs}
\label{rule:angle-off}

Other situations described in these rules depend on the angle at which one element is seen from another. For example, radars are typically restricted to scanning over forward cone and, early infrared-homing missiles could only track targets from behind.

This angle can be considered only horizontally or both horizontally and vertically. The horizontal arcs described here consider and quantify only the horizontal component. The combined arcs described subsequently consider and quantify both the horizontally and vertically components.

\paragraph{Reference and Distant Elements.} 

For clarity, we will define the relative position of a \emph{distant element}  with respect to a \emph{reference element}. These roles depend on the context:

\begin{itemize}

\item In air-to-air gun, rocket, and missile attacks (rules~\ref{rule:air-to-air-gun-combat}, \ref{rule:air-to-air-rocket-combat}, and \ref{rule:missile-attacks}), the target aircraft is the reference element, and the attacking aircraft or missile is the distant element.

\item For visual sighting (rule~\ref{rule:sighting-aircraft-and-missiles}), the sighting aircraft is the reference element, and the aircraft, missile, or ground unit being sighted is the distant element.

\item For advantage (rule~\ref{rule:initiative}), the aircraft potentially in a superior position is the reference element, and the aircraft potentially in an inferior position is the distant element.

\item For missile launch envelopes and IRM target aspect launch requirements (rules~\ref{rule:missile-launches} and \ref{rule:irm-launch-requirements}), the target aircraft is the reference element, and the launching aircraft is the distant element.

\item When determining the field of view of sensors, the aircraft or missile sensing is the reference element, and the aircraft or ground unit being sensed is the distant element. Sensors include:
\begin{itemize} 
\item VAS (rule~\ref{rule:vas}),
\item IRSTS (rule~\ref{rule:irsts}),
\item missile seekers (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-missiles}),
\item air-to-air radar (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-radar}).
\item air-to-ground radar (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-ground-radar}).
\end{itemize}

\item When determining the field of effect of jammers, the aircraft jamming is the reference element, and the radar being jammed is the distant element.

\item When determining the field of laser designators (rule~\ref{rule:laser-guided-weapons}), the designating aircraft is the reference aircraft, and the target is the distant element.

\item When determining the field of heavy AAA units, the AAA unit is the reference element and the aircraft being targeted is the distant element.

\end{itemize}


\input{figures/figure-angle-off}
\input{tables/tables-angle-off}

\paragraph{Angle-Off.} 

The relative horizontal position of the distant element with respect to the reference element is quantified by the horizontal angle between two imaginary lines, one extending behind the tail of the reference element and the other between the reference element and the distant element. This angle is known as the \emph{angle off the tail} or simply the \emph{angle-off}. 

If the distant element is directly behind the reference element, the angle-off is \arc{0}; if it is directly on the beam, the angle-off is \arc{90}; and if it is directly in front, the angle-off is \arc{180}.

\paragraph{Horizontal Arcs.} 

Angle-off is grouped into \emph{horizontal arcs} covering \arc{30} to the left or right of the target. Figure~\ref{figure:angle-off} shows these arcs. The reference element is at the center, and the arcs radiate from it. The appropriate figure is used according to whether the reference element is in a hex facing a hex corner, in a hex facing a hex side, or on a hex side.

\paragraph{Borderline Procedure.} 

The distant element will often unambiguously be in a horizontal arc. However, sometimes it will be located on the borderline between two arcs. In these cases, use the disambiguation procedure described below and summarized in Tables \ref{table:angle-off-borderlines} and \ref{table:angle-off-adjacent}.

In the context of the fields of sensors, jammers, and laser designators, if either or both of the adjacent arcs are within the field, the borderline is also considered to be within the field. (In other words, the fields include the borderlines.)

In other contexts, if the distant element is on the border between the two \arc{0} arcs or the two \arc{180} arcs, it is considered to be in the \arc{0} arc or \arc{180} arc. This rule does not specify whether it falls in the left or right arcs, but this is never relevant to the game rules. 

% TODO: How do we disambiguate missile envelopes and IRM launch requirements? Included would work for the latter, but not for the former.

For the other borderlines, the procedure for determining the arc is more complex. Consider the speeds of the reference element and distant element at the start of the game turn:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the reference element is slower, the distant element is in the arc it would move into if it moved forward.
\item If the reference element is faster, the distant element is in the arc it would move into if the reference element moved forward.
\item If neither is faster or if the distant element remains on the borderline after one of the previous two cases (i.e., it is facing directly towards or away from the reference element), the resolution again depends on the context:
\begin{itemize}
\item For gun and rocket attacks (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-gun-combat}), the distant element (attacking aircraft) is considered to be in the narrower arc.
\item For determining blind and restricted arcs (rule \ref{rule:sighting-aircraft-and-missiles}), the distant element (element being sighted) is considered to be in the rearward arc.
\item For determining advantage purposes (rule~\ref{rule:initiative}), the distant element (element potentially disadvantaged) is considered to be in the rearward arc.
\item For missile launch envelopes (rule~\ref{rule:missile-launches}), IRM target aspect launch requirements (rule~\ref{rule:irm-launch-requirements})), and missile attacks (rule~\ref{rule:missile-attacks}), the distant element (launching aircraft or attacking missile) is considered to be in the wider arc.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The narrower arc is the arc further from the \arc{120} arc. The wider arc is the arc closer to the \arc{120} arc. The rearward arc is the arc closer to the \arc{30} arc.

Ground elements are always considered to be slower than any aircraft.

\paragraph{Same-Location Procedure}
If the reference and distant element are at the same map location (i.e., the same hex or hex side), the horizontal arc is the same as if the distant element (i.e., the non-reference element) were moved backward one hex.

Moving the distant element backward would always leave it on a borderline facing the reference element, requiring the use of the disambiguation procedure for borderlines described above.

\paragraph{The \arc{0} and \arc{180} Lines.} The imaginary lines extending behind and ahead of the reference element are the \arc{0} and \arc{180} lines, respectively. Although not formally arcs, these lines are, at times, treated as such. To count as being on one of these lines, the distant element must be on the borderline and facing directly along it towards the reference element. If they are on the line but not facing directly along it towards the target, they are considered in either the \arc{30} or \arc{180} arc but not on the \arc{0} or \arc{180} lines.

\paragraph{Horizontal Arc Examples.}

Consider Figure~\ref{figure:angle-off}, in which the aircraft A1, A2, and A3 are the reference elements and aircraft B1, B2,  B3, C1, C2, and C3 are distant elements. 

Aircraft C2 is unambiguously on the \arc{0} line, and C1 is unambiguously in the right \arc{90} arc, but the other attackers are on borderlines between two arcs. Aircraft C3 cannot be on the \arc{0} line as it is not facing the target and so is in the \arc{30} arc.

\begin{itemize}

\item
In the context of the field sensors, jammers, or laser designators, distant elements on borderlines are considered to be within the field if either or both adjacent arcs are within the field. B1 would be within the field only if either the right \arc{60} arc, the right \arc{90} arc, or both were within the field. B2 would be within the field only if either the right \arc{150} arc, the right \arc{180} arc, or both were within the field. B3 would be within the field only if either the left \arc{90} arc, the left \arc{120} arc, or both were within the field.

\item In other contexts, we need to consider the relative speeds of the reference and distant elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
If the reference elements were slower than the distant elements, then B2 and B3 would be considered to be in the arcs into which they move if they moved forward: B2 would be in the right \arc{150} arc, and B3 would be in the left \arc{120} arc.

\item
If the reference elements were faster than the distant elements, then B2 and B3 would be considered to be in the arcs into which they move if the reference element moved forward: B2 would be in the right \arc{150} arc and B3 would be in the left \arc{90} arc.

\item
If the reference element and the distant aircraft had the same speeds, then the context would determine whether B2 and B3 are considered to be in the narrower, wider, or rearward arc. The same procedure would be used for B1 regardless of the relative speeds since B1 is facing along a borderline.

\begin{itemize}

\item For gun and rocket attacks, the distant elements are in the narrower arc, so B1 would be in the right \arc{90} arc, B2 in the right \arc{180} arc, and B3 in the right \arc{90} arc.

\item For missile attacks (for which the distant elements would be missiles), the distant elements are in the wider arc, so B1 would be in the right \arc{120} arc, B2 in the right \arc{150} arc, and B3 in the right \arc{120} arc.

\item For visual sighting and advantage, the distant elements are in the rearward arc, so B1 would be in the right \arc{90} arc, B2 in the right \arc{150} arc, and B3 in the right \arc{120} arc.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Ranges of Horizontal Arcs.}
\label{rule:ranges-of-angle-off-arcs}

Ranges of horizontal arcs are used for restricted or blind regions for sighting, sensor fields of view, and determining advantage. If a range is given as an arc followed by a plus sign, it consists of those arcs and all more forward arcs. If a range is given as an arc followed by a minus sign, it consists of those arcs and all more rearward arcs. Ranges specified in this way consist of both the left and right arcs.

For example, a blind arc given as $\arcrange{60}{-}$ consists the \arc{30} and \arc{60} arcs and a radar search field given as $\arcrange{150}{+}$ consists of the \arc{150} and \arc{180} arcs. 

\paragraph{Lower Horizontal Arcs.}
\label{rule:lower-angle-off-arcs}

Restricted or blind regions for sighting are sometimes given as \arc{30}L, \arc{60}L, or \arc{180}L. These refer to the \arcrange{30}{-}, \arcrange{60}{-}, or \arcrange{180}{+} arc ranges but only apply to distant elements at lower altitudes.

For example, a restricted arc given as \arc{180}{L} refers to the \arc{180} arcs but only for distant elements at lower altitudes and might apply to an aircraft whose nose obscures the view from the cockpit forward and downwards.

\AY[3A-limited-arcs]{

\paragraph{Limited Horizontal Arcs.}
\label{rule:limited-arcs}

\input{figures/figure-limited-arc}

Some sensors and rules make use of a \emph{limited horizontal arc} that is even narrower than the \arcrange{180}{+} horizontal arc. Figure~\ref{figure:limited-arcs} shows the limited arc. In this figure, only the map locations within the limited arc line are within the limited arc. 

If an aircraft is banked (see rule \ref{rule:direction-of-bank}), instead of the limited arc, it may elect to use the \arc{180} arc with the same sense as its bank.

\AY[3A-combined-arcs]{

\section{Combined Arcs}
\label{rule:vertical-arcs}
\label{rule:vertical-limits}


Aircraft and missile sensors have fields that are limited not just horizontally but also vertically. The \emph{combined arcs} described here extend the horizontal arcs above to include appropriate vertical limits.

Combined arcs are used to determine if a target is in the field of:
\begin{itemize} 
\item VAS (rule~\ref{rule:vas}),
\item IRSTS (rule~\ref{rule:irsts}),
\item missile seekers (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-missiles}), 
\item air-to-air radar (rule~\ref{rule:air-to-air-radar}), and
\item laser designators (rule~\ref{rule:laser-guided-weapons}).
\end{itemize}
They are also used to determine if the target satisfies the aspect requirements for IRM launches (rule~\ref{rule:irm-launch-requirements}). They are not used elsewhere.

\paragraph{Flight Slope.}

The \emph{flight slope} characterizes the vertical orientation of the reference element just as its facing characterizes its horizontal orientation.

The flight slope is calculated over a number of FPs (defined below) as the number of altitude levels gained divided by the number of HFPs expended. 

The flight slope will be positive if the element gains altitude, zero if it maintains altitude, and negative if it loses altitude. For purely vertical flight with no HFPs, the flight slope will be positive infinity ($+\infty$) for climbing or negative infinity ($-\infty$) for diving.

For an aircraft and missile prior to launch, determine the flight slope by considering all of the FPs expended by the aircraft or by the missile’s launching aircraft in the previous flight phase. 

For a missile in flight, if the previous proportional move had two or more FPs, determine the flight slope by considering them all. Otherwise, if the previous proportional move only had one FP and was the first one of the missile’s flight, determine the flight slope from that FP and the last FP of the launching aircraft prior to launch. Otherwise, determine the flight slope from the missile’s last two FPs.

For example, if an aircraft executes level flight with four HFPs and no free descent, its flight slope is 0. If it executes the same but with free descent, its flight slope is $-1/4 = -0.25$. If it executes a zoom climb with three HFPs and four VFPs, gaining seven altitude levels, its flight slope is $+7/3 \approx 2.33$. If it executes a vertical dive with no HFPs and six VFPs, losing twelve altitude levels, its flight slope is $-12/0 = -\infty$.

\paragraph{Combined Arcs Procedure.}

\input{tables/table-combined-arcs}

%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item For a pure vertical climb the flight slope is $+\infty$ and Table~X gives a single positive vertical limit factor in parentheses. Multiply it by the horizontal range to the distant element and add the altitude of the reference element to determine the lower altitude limit.
%
%The distant element is within the combined arc if:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Its altitude is greater than or equal to the lower altitude limit.
%\end{itemize}
%There is no requirement on the horizontal arc; the distant element can be in any horizontal arc since for pure vertical flight the interpretation of facing is ambiguous.
%
%\item For a pure vertical dive the flight slope is $-\infty$ and Table~X gives a single negative vertical limit factor in parentheses. Multiply it by the horizontal range to the distant element and add the altitude of the reference element to determine the upper altitude limit.
%
%The distant element is within the combined arc if:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Its altitude is less than or equal to the lower altitude limit.
%\end{itemize}
%Again, there is no requirement on the horizontal arc.
%
%\item If Table~X gives two vertical limit factors that are not in parentheses, then the first is the lower limit factor and the second is the upper limit factor. Multiply both of them by the horizontal range to the distant element to determine the lower and upper altitude limits. Round up the lower altitude limit and round down the upper altitude limit. 
%
%The distant element is within the combined arc if:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item It is within the corresponding horizontal arc,
%\item The altitude difference is greater than or equal to the lower altitude limit, and
%\item The altitude difference is less than or equal to the upper altitude limit.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\item If Table~X gives two vertical limit factors and the second is in parentheses, then the first is the normal lower limit factor and the second is the all-round lower limit factor. Multiply both of them by the horizontal range to the distant element to determine the normal lower and all-round lower altitude limits. Round up the normal lower altitude limit.
%
%The distant element is within the combined arc if either:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item It is within the corresponding horizontal arc, and
%\item Its altitude is greater than or equal to the normal lower altitude limit,
%\end{itemize}
%or
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Its altitude is greater than or equal to the all-round lower limit.
%\end{itemize}
%In the second case, there is no requirement on the horizontal arc.
%
%\item If Table~X gives two vertical limit factors and the first is in parentheses, then  the first is the all-round upper limit factor and the second is the normal upper limit factor. Multiply both of them by the horizontal range to the distant element to determine the normal upper and all-round upper altitude limits. Round down the normal upper altitude limit.
%
%The distant element is within the combined arc if either:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item It is within the corresponding horizontal arc, and
%\item Its altitude is less than or equal to the normal upper altitude limit,
%\end{itemize}
%or
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Its altitude is less than or equal to the all-round upper limit.
%\end{itemize}
%In the second case, there is no requirement on the horizontal arc.
%
%
%\end{itemize}

Cross-reference the arc and the flight slope in Table~\ref{table:vertical-limit-factors}. Note that there is one column for the flight slope for forward arcs (the limited, \arcrange{180}{+}, \arcrange{150}{+}, and \arcrange{120}{+} arcs) and another for rearward arcs (the \arcrange{30}{-},  \arcrange{60}{-}, and  \arcrange{90}{-} arcs). The entries in the table are one or two numerical vertical limit factors indicating upper ($\le$) or lower ($\ge$) limits. The factors themselves are either in parentheses or not in parentheses.

\begin{itemize}

\item
The factors not in parentheses are \emph{mixed} vertical limit factors. They are multiplied by the horizontal range from the reference to the distant element, rounded up if lower limits and rounded down if upper limits, and then give the \emph{maximum} number of levels that the distant aircraft can be above ($\le$) or below ($\ge$) the reference aircraft and still be within the combined arc. 

In these cases, the distant aircraft must also be in the corresponding horizontal arc to be within the combined arc.

\item
The factors in parentheses are \emph{pure} vertical limit factors. They are multiplied by the horizontal range from the reference to the distant element and then give the \emph{minimum} number of levels that the distant aircraft can be above ($\ge$) or below ($\le$) the reference aircraft and still be in the combined arc. 

In these cases, the distant aircraft \emph{need not} be in the corresponding horizontal arc; it can be in \emph{any} horizontal arc.

\end{itemize}

If Table~\ref{table:vertical-limit-factors} gives one factor, the distant element is within the combined arc if it satisfies the corresponding conditions. If Table~\ref{table:vertical-limit-factors} gives two factors, they will be combined with “and” or “or.” In the case of “and,” the distant element is within the combined arc if it satisfiers both of the corresponding conditions. In the case of “or,” the distant element is within the combined arc if it satisfies either of the corresponding conditions.
